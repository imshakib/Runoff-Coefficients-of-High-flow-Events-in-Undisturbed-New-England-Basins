Abstract
Floods in the Northeast U.S endanger people and infrastructure. The frequency and magnitude of large precipitation events and high-flow events have both recently increased, but few studies have evaluated whether recent changes are proportional. This study determined the fraction of precipitation and snowmelt converted into surface runoff during high-flow events from 1981-2016 within 28 undisturbed New England basins with natural flow conditions. The average run-off coefficient of high-flow events across all basins was 0.52. Runoff coefficient magnitude increased from north to south, likely reflecting regional differences in snow accumulation and melt. Over the last 36 years, runoff coefficients have been generally stationary, suggesting that increases in the size of rainfall‐driven and rain‐on‐snow floods have so far offset decreases in the size of snowmelt‐driven floods in New England. Runoff coefficients may provide useful insights to future flood recurrence intervals resulting from changes in input precipitation, at least under conditions during which flood-generation mechanisms remain similar to current conditions. In addition, this study can serve as a reference point for future exploration of the flood susceptibility in basins with anthropogenic alterations including dam construction, dam removal, or land use change.
